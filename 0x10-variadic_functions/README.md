## Introduction to Variadic Functions

Variadic functions are functions in C that can accept a variable number of arguments. They provide flexibility and convenience when the number of arguments is not fixed. Variadic functions are declared using the ellipsis (...) notation in the function prototype.

## Repository Overview

The `0x10-variadic_functions` repository contains the following files:

1. `0-sum_them_all.c`: This file includes a variadic function that calculates the sum of a variable number of integers.

2. `1-print_numbers.c`: This file includes a variadic function that prints a variable number of integers, separated by a specified delimiter.

3. `2-print_strings.c`: This file includes a variadic function that prints a variable number of strings.

4. `3-print_all.c`: This file includes a variadic function that prints a variable number of elements of different types, based on a specified format.

5. `variadic_functions.h`: This header file contains the function prototypes for the variadic functions defined in the above files.

Please note that to compile and run these files, you will need a C compiler installed on your system.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
```   
git clone https://github.com/khaoula1972/alx-low_level_programming.git
``` 
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd alx-low_level_programming\0x12-singly_linked_lists
```
3. Compile the codes:
``` 
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o linked_list
``` 
Replace `*.c` with the specific files you want to compile, or use `*.asm` for assembly files.

3. Run the compiled program:
``` 
./linked_list
``` 
Adjust the command based on the specific executable file you have generated.

Please note that you may need to have a C compiler, such as GCC, installed on your system to compile the code successfully.
