## Introduction to Function Pointers

Function pointers in C are variables that store addresses of functions. They provide a way to pass functions as arguments to other functions or to store and invoke them dynamically. Function pointers enable the creation of more flexible and modular code structures.

## Repository Overview

The `0x0F-function_pointers` repository contains the following files:

1. `0-print_name.c`: This file includes a function that takes a function pointer as a parameter and prints a name using the provided function.

2. `1-array_iterator.c`: This file includes a function that takes a function pointer as a parameter and applies the provided function to each element of an array.

3. `100-main_opcodes.c`: This file includes a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.

4. `2-int_index.c`: This file includes a function that searches for an integer in an array using a given comparison function.

5. `function_pointers.h`: This header file contains the function prototypes for the functions defined in the above files.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
```   
git clone https://github.com/khaoula1972/alx-low_level_programming.git
``` 
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd alx-low_level_programming\0x0F-function_pointers
```
3. Compile the codes:
``` 
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o function_pointers
``` 
Replace `*.c` with the specific files you want to compile, or use `*.asm` for assembly files.

3. Run the compiled program:
``` 
./function_pointers
``` 
Adjust the command based on the specific executable file you have generated.

Please note that you may need to have a C compiler, such as GCC, installed on your system to compile the code successfully.
