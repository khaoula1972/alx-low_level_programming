## Introduction

The `0x01-variables_if_else_while` directory contains several C programs that showcase different concepts related to variables, if-else statements, and while loops. These programs cover topics such as printing numbers, alphabets, and combinations.

## Repository Overview

The `0x01-variables_if_else_while` repository consists of the following files:

1. `0-positive_or_negative.c`: This file contains a program that determines if a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.

2. `1-last_digit.c`: This file contains a program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and determines if it is greater than 5, zero, or less than 6 and not zero.

3. `100-print_comb3.c`: This file contains a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

4. `101-print_comb4.c`: This file contains a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

5. `102-print_comb5.c`: This file contains a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

6. `2-print_alphabet.c`: This file contains a program that prints the lowercase alphabet using a while loop.

7. `3-print_alphabets.c`: This file contains a program that prints the lowercase and uppercase alphabets using nested while loops.

8. `4-print_alphabt.c`: This file contains a program that prints the lowercase alphabet excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

9. `5-print_numbers.c`: This file contains a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using a while loop.

10. `6-print_numberz.c`: This file contains a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using only the `putchar` function.

11. `7-print_tebahpla.c`: This file contains a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using a while loop.

12. `8-print_base16.c`: This file contains a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase using a while loop.

13. `9-print_comb.c`: This file contains a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

## Getting Started
