## Custom Projects

### printf

The `printf` project is a custom implementation of the `printf` function in the C programming language. This project was a collaboration between myself and [Ella4040](https://github.com/Ella4040). The implementation provides similar functionality to the standard library `printf` function, allowing for formatted output to the console.

The source code for the `printf` project can be found in [Ella4040's repository](https://github.com/Ella4040/printf). It includes various files, such as the main `printf` function, formatting specifiers, and helper functions.

Feel free to check out the `printf` project and explore the codebase. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!

## Contributing

## Plagiarism for SE Students in ALX

_Reminder :_ 
- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks in ALX projects yourself to meet with the learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this program by copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

If you're a SE ALX Student, I firstly want to congratulate you on chosing this path and I want to remind you that as a SE Student myself that copy-paste rule won't get us anywhere far in this competitive industry so please be careful and always remember : "Always do the hard work !"
