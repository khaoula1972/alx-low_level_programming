## Introduction to Structures and Typedef

Structures in C allow you to define custom data types that can hold multiple variables of different types. Typedef, on the other hand, provides a way to create aliases for existing data types. Together, structures and typedef enhance code readability and allow for better organization and abstraction.

## Repository Overview

The `0x0E-structures_typedef` repository contains the following files:

1. `1-init_dog.c`: This file includes a function that initializes a structure of type `dog` with provided values.

2. `2-print_dog.c`: This file includes a function that prints the contents of a structure of type `dog`.

3. `4-new_dog.c`: This file includes a function that creates a new structure of type `dog` and initializes its members with provided values.

4. `5-free_dog.c`: This file includes a function that frees the memory allocated for a structure of type `dog`.

5. `dog.h`: This header file contains the structure definition for type `dog` and the function prototypes for the functions defined in the above files.
