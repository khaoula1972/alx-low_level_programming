## Introduction to Singly Linked Lists

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element, known as a node, is composed of data and a link to the next node in the sequence.

## Repository Overview

The 0x12-singly_linked_lists repository contains various files related to singly linked lists, including the following key files:

1. `list_len.c`: This file includes a function that calculates the number of elements in a given singly linked list and returns the count.

2. `100-first.c`: This file contains a function that is executed before the `main` function. It prints a message to the standard output.

3. `101-hello_holberton.asm`: This assembly file includes a function that prints "Hello, Holberton" to the standard output.

4. `2-add_node.c`: This file includes a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list. The function takes two arguments: a pointer to the head of the list and a string to be stored in the new node.

5. `3-add_node_end.c`: This file includes a function that adds a new node at the end of a singly linked list. The function takes two arguments: a pointer to the head of the list and a string to be stored in the new node.

6. `4-free_list.c`: This file includes a function that frees the memory occupied by a singly linked list. It takes a pointer to the head of the list as an argument.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
   
- git clone https://github.com/khaoula1972/alx-low_level_programming.git

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   
- gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o linked_list

Replace `*.c` with the specific files you want to compile, or use `*.asm` for assembly files.

3. Run the compiled program:
   
- ./linked_list

Adjust the command based on the specific executable file you have generated.

Please note that you may need to have a C compiler, such as GCC, installed on your system to compile the code successfully.
