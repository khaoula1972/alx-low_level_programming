## Introduction

The `0x05-pointers_arrays_strings` directory contains various C programs that demonstrate the usage of pointers, arrays, and strings to perform different tasks.

## Repository Overview

The `0x05-pointers_arrays_strings` repository consists of the following files:

1. `0-reset_to_98.c`: This file contains a function that takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

2. `1-swap.c`: This file contains a function that swaps the values of two integers.

3. `2-strlen.c`: This file contains a function that calculates the length of a string.

4. `3-puts.c`: This file contains a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

5. `4-print_rev.c`: This file contains a function that prints a string in reverse, followed by a new line.

6. `5-rev_string.c`: This file contains a function that reverses a string.

7. `6-puts2.c`: This file contains a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.

8. `7-puts_half.c`: This file contains a function that prints the second half of a string.

9. `8-print_array.c`: This file contains a function that prints the elements of an array of integers.

10. `9-strcpy.c`: This file contains a function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.

11. `100-atoi.c`: This file contains a function that converts a string to an integer.

12. `101-keygen.c`: This file contains a program that generates random valid passwords for the `101-crackme` executable.
