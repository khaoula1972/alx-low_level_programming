## Introduction

This directory contains C source code files related to file input and output (I/O) operations. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of file I/O, providing examples and solutions to common tasks.

## Repository Overview

1. [`0-read_textfile.c`](./0-read_textfile.c): This file demonstrates how to read and print the content of a text file to the standard output.
   
2. [`1-create_file.c`](./1-create_file.c): This file showcases how to create a new file and write text into it.
   
3. [`2-append_text_to_file.c`](./2-append_text_to_file.c): This file illustrates how to append text to an existing file.
   
4. [`3-cp.c`](./3-cp.c): This file provides a simple implementation of the `cp` command, allowing you to copy the contents of one file to another.
   
5. [`main.h`](./main.h): This header file contains function prototypes used across the C source code files.
