## Introduction

The `0x02-functions_nested_loops` directory contains several C programs that showcase different concepts related to functions and nested loops. These programs cover topics such as printing characters, numbers, times tables, and performing mathematical operations.

## Repository Overview

The `0x02-functions_nested_loops` repository consists of the following files:

1. `0-putchar.c`: This file contains a program that prints the lowercase alphabet using the `_putchar` function.

2. `1-alphabet.c`: This file contains a program that prints the lowercase alphabet using a function called `print_alphabet`.

3. `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: This file contains a program that prints the lowercase alphabet ten times using nested loops.

4. `3-islower.c`: This file contains a function that checks if a given character is lowercase.

5. `4-isalpha.c`: This file contains a function that checks if a given character is an alphabetic letter.

6. `5-sign.c`: This file contains a function that prints the sign of a number (+, 0, or -).

7. `6-abs.c`: This file contains a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

8. `7-print_last_digit.c`: This file contains a function that prints the last digit of a number.

9. `8-24_hours.c`: This file contains a function that prints every minute of a day (24-hour clock format).

10. `9-times_table.c`: This file contains a function that prints the multiplication table of the numbers 0-9.

11. `10-add.c`: This file contains a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

12. `11-print_to_98.c`: This file contains a function that prints all natural numbers from a given number to 98.

13. `100-times_table.c`: This file contains an extended version of the `9-times_table.c` program, allowing custom table sizes.

14. `101-natural.c`: This file contains a program that computes and prints the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.

15. `102-fibonacci.c`: This file contains a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting from 1 and 2.

16. `103-fibonacci.c`: This file contains a program that prints the sum of even-valued Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit.

17. `main.h`: This header file contains function prototypes used in the various programs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
```   
git clone https://github.com/khaoula1972/alx-low_level_programming.git
``` 
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd alx-low_level_programming\0x02-functions_nested_loops
```
3. Compile the codes:
``` 
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o functions_nested_loops
``` 
Replace `*.c` with the specific files you want to compile.

3. Run the compiled program:
``` 
./functions_nested_loops
``` 
Adjust the command based on the specific executable file you have generated.

Please note that you may need to have a C compiler, such as GCC, installed on your system to compile the code successfully.
