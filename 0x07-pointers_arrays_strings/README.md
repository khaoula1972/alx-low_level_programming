## Introduction

The `0x07-pointers_arrays_strings` directory contains various C programs that demonstrate the usage of pointers, arrays, and strings to perform different tasks.

## Repository Overview

The `0x07-pointers_arrays_strings` repository consists of the following files:

1. `0-memset.c`: This file contains a function that fills a block of memory with a specific byte.

2. `1-memcpy.c`: This file contains a function that copies memory area from one location to another.

3. `2-strchr.c`: This file contains a function that locates the first occurrence of a character in a string.

4. `3-strspn.c`: This file contains a function that gets the length of a prefix substring consisting of only specific characters.

5. `4-strpbrk.c`: This file contains a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

6. `5-strstr.c`: This file contains a function that finds the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

7. `7-print_chessboard.c`: This file contains a function that prints the chessboard.

8. `8-print_diagsums.c`: This file contains a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

9. `100-set_string.c`: This file contains a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

10. `_putchar.c`: This file contains the implementation of the `_putchar` function used in other files.

11. `main.h`: This header file contains the function prototypes used in the C programs.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
```   
git clone https://github.com/khaoula1972/alx-low_level_programming.git
``` 
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd alx-low_level_programming\0x07-pointers_arrays_strings
```
3. Compile the codes:
``` 
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o pointers_arrays_strings
``` 
Replace `*.c` with the specific files you want to compile, or use `*.asm` for assembly files.

3. Run the compiled program:
``` 
./pointers_arrays_strings
``` 
Adjust the command based on the specific executable file you have generated.

Please note that you may need to have a C compiler, such as GCC, installed on your system to compile the code successfully.
