## Introduction to Preprocessor

The preprocessor is a step in the C compilation process that performs text replacement before the actual compilation takes place. It is responsible for handling directives that start with a `#` symbol and modifying the source code accordingly. Preprocessor directives are used to include header files, define constants, perform macro substitution, and conditional compilation.

## Repository Overview

The `0x0D-preprocessor` repository contains the following files:

1. `0-object_like_macro.h`: This header file defines a macro named `SIZE` with a numeric value.

2. `1-pi.h`: This header file defines a macro named `PI` with the value of pi (3.14159265359).

3. `2-main.c`: This C source file includes the main function where you can test the functionality of the preprocessor directives.

4. `3-function_like_macro.h`: This header file defines a macro named `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

5. `4-sum.h`: This header file defines a macro named `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of two numbers `x` and `y`.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
```   
git clone https://github.com/khaoula1972/alx-low_level_programming.git
``` 
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd alx-low_level_programming\0x0D-preprocessor
```
3. Compile the codes:
``` 
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o preprocessor
``` 
Replace `*.c` with the specific files you want to compile, or use `*.asm` for assembly files.

3. Run the compiled program:
``` 
./preprocessor
``` 
Adjust the command based on the specific executable file you have generated.

Please note that you may need to have a C compiler, such as GCC, installed on your system to compile the code successfully.
