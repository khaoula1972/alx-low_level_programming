## Introduction to Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. In C, recursive functions are used to solve problems that can be defined in terms of similar or smaller instances of the same problem.

## Repository Overview

The `0x08-recursion` repository contains the following files:

1. `0-puts_recursion.c`: This file contains a function that prints a string followed by a new line using recursion.

2. `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: This file contains a function that prints a string in reverse using recursion.

3. `100-is_palindrome.c`: This file contains a function that checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.

4. `101-wildcmp.c`: This file contains a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise returns 0. The comparison can include the special character `*`, which can match any string.

5. `2-strlen_recursion.c`: This file contains a function that returns the length of a string using recursion.

6. `3-factorial.c`: This file contains a function that returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.

7. `4-pow_recursion.c`: This file contains a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y using recursion.

8. `5-sqrt_recursion.c`: This file contains a function that returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.

9. `6-is_prime_number.c`: This file contains a function that checks if a number is a prime number using recursion.

10. `main.h`: This header file contains the function prototypes used in the provided source files.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
```   
git clone https://github.com/khaoula1972/alx-low_level_programming.git
``` 
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd alx-low_level_programming\0x08-recursion
```
3. Compile the codes:
``` 
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o recursion
``` 
Replace `*.c` with the specific files you want to compile.

3. Run the compiled program:
``` 
./recursion
``` 
Adjust the command based on the specific executable file you have generated.

Please note that you may need to have a C compiler, such as GCC, installed on your system to compile the code successfully.
