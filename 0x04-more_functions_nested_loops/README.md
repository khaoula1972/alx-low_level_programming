## Introduction

The `0x04-more_functions_nested_loops` directory contains various C programs that demonstrate the usage of additional functions and nested loops to perform different tasks.

## Repository Overview

The `0x04-more_functions_nested_loops` repository consists of the following files:

1. `0-isupper.c`: This file contains a function that checks whether a given character is an uppercase letter.

2. `1-isdigit.c`: This file contains a function that checks whether a given character is a digit.

3. `2-mul.c`: This file contains a function that multiplies two integers and returns the result.

4. `3-print_numbers.c`: This file contains a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

5. `4-print_most_numbers.c`: This file contains a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4, followed by a new line.

6. `5-more_numbers.c`: This file contains a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 14 ten times, followed by a new line.

7. `6-print_line.c`: This file contains a function that draws a straight line using the character `_`, based on a given length.

8. `7-print_diagonal.c`: This file contains a function that draws a diagonal line using the character `\`, based on a given length.

9. `8-print_square.c`: This file contains a function that prints a square using the character `#`, based on a given size.

10. `9-fizz_buzz.c`: This file contains a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".

11. `main.h`: This header file contains function prototypes used in the various programs.
