## Introduction

The `0x06-pointers_arrays_strings` directory contains various C programs that demonstrate the usage of pointers, arrays, and strings to perform different tasks.

## Repository Overview

The `0x06-pointers_arrays_strings` repository consists of the following files:

1. `0-strcat.c`: This file contains a function that concatenates two strings.

2. `1-strncat.c`: This file contains a function that concatenates a portion of one string to another string.

3. `2-strncpy.c`: This file contains a function that copies a portion of one string to another string.

4. `3-strcmp.c`: This file contains a function that compares two strings.

5. `4-rev_array.c`: This file contains a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

6. `5-string_toupper.c`: This file contains a function that converts all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase.

7. `6-cap_string.c`: This file contains a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.

8. `7-leet.c`: This file contains a function that encodes a string into 1337 (leet) format.

9. `100-rot13.c`: This file contains a function that encodes a string using the rot13 cipher.

10. `101-print_number.c`: This file contains a function that prints an integer using only `_putchar` function.

11. `102-magic.c`: This file contains a program that prints a specific string using a magic trick.

12. `103-infinite_add.c`: This file contains a function that adds two numbers stored as strings.

13. `104-print_buffer.c`: This file contains a function that prints the content of a buffer.

14. `_putchar.c`: This file contains the implementation of the `_putchar` function used in other files.

15. `main.h`: This header file contains the function prototypes used in the C programs.
